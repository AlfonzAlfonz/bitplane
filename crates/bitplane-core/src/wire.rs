//! What crosses a transport.

//! The traits are the ergonomic face; this pair plus [`dispatch`] is what a
//! remote surface speaks (ADR-0003). `dispatch` is a `match`, so an action put
//! on the wire and forgotten in the dispatch fails to compile.
//!
//! One request is one user intent — coarse granularity, so a remote transport
//! is not a latency disaster — and a response is a single value, with streamed
//! progress deferred.
